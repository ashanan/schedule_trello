Run this script every day with cron:
crontab -e
0 5 * * * /full/path/to/schedule_trello.py
(This will schedule it to run every day at 5 AM. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto for more info.)

Depends on py-trello (https://github.com/sarumont/py-trello)

Rename auth.config.example to auth.config and replace the placeholders with real values.

Edit schedule_trello.py and replace "/absolute/path/to/" on lines 19 and 24 with the actual absolute path.  If you don't do this the script won't be able to find the config files when run by cron.
